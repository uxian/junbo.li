Welcome to the personal blog of Junbo Li. A fusion of intellect and curiosity, this space is dedicated to exploring the profound connections between AI, physics, philosophy, and life itself. Join me on a journey through complex algorithms, cosmic wonders, philosophical inquiries, and reflections on everyday existence. Together, we'll unravel the mysteries of the universe, one thought at a time.
