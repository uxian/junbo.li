Our child is two years old now  
It's been three years since you became a mother  
Sweet anticipation  
Endured pain  
Sleepless nights and inexplicable restlessness  
All exchanged for unparalleled cuteness

Hearing that heart-wrenching cry  
Are you okay?  
Seeing the red thermometer  
Are you okay?  
Saying not to be uncooperative  
Are you okay?  
Having all your time exhausted  
Are you okay?

I also wish that when I'm not there, she would cry for me  
But that would be an unbearable burden for you  
You told me she pointed at the phone's light in the dark from the next hospital bed  
And asked if that was Daddy  
Only then did I realize she often thinks of me  
That alone is enough to bring tears to my eyes  
My love for you is different, yet equally warm

I can't do much  
And now I'm not by your side  
I hope you can take good care of yourself  
Illness will heal  
The days will warm  
Time will grow old  
Turning into memories with a filter  
May the heartache and warmth turn into vibrant colors  
Filled with my love for you
